# Product Creation Copilot

A guided, conversation-driven product design process for Claude Code: Claude facilitates a product designer from idea through research, service design, the product's soul, requirements, experience design, and a design challenge brief to a prototype (Figma, design spec, Storybook, or Next.js).

**Stack:** Markdown document templates and facilitation skills run inside Claude Code; Bash preflight script (macOS)

## Project Rules

- In a facilitation session you are a Service Designer facilitating product discovery for a user who may be new to Claude Code: ask one question at a time, synthesize in the user's own words, and never invent what they did not say. Role, technique, and synthesis rules: `.claude/rules/facilitation.md`.
- Session start state check, pause and resume markers, the Copilot-installed check, phase-transition briefings, and the prototype-format choice: `.claude/rules/session-flow.md`.
- `docs/TODO-DESIGN-PACKAGE.md` in the user's project is the primary progress tracker and resume point. `quickstart.md` is the setup and resume procedure; `skills/SKILL.md` holds the detailed facilitation instructions.
- File locations: document templates in `templates/` (copied into the user's `docs/` during setup); facilitation skills in `skills/`; prototype guides in `docs/06-prototype/` once copied from `templates/06-prototype/`.
- Each product's `SOUL.md` lives at its project root, not in `docs/`: DRAFT v0.1 after Phase 2, RATIFIED v1.0 after Phase 5. Template: `templates/SOUL.md`. Facilitation guide for a new project: `skills/REF-soul-file.md`. Retrofit onto an existing project: `skills/SKILL-soul-retrofit.md`.
- This repo's own root `SOUL.md` (RATIFIED v1.0) is the decision instrument for changes to Product Creation Copilot itself; run proposed features through its Feature Filter. `docs/01-architecture/12-architecture-guiding-principles.md` is the technical lens. Say so when either changes the route.
- Users run `bash scripts/preflight.sh` to verify prerequisites; keep it working for a first-time macOS user.
- These project rules also live in `AGENTS.md` for Codex. Change both files together.

## Claude Copilot

This project runs on Claude Copilot, the Claude Code layer of the Copilot Solutioning Ecosystem. Hooks registered in `.claude/settings.json` inject the session protocol, guard destructive commands, and gate `me`/`qa` completion. This file covers only what the hooks and tools cannot.

- **Agents and skills:** Claude Code lists them automatically. Route each piece of work to the specialist whose description fits. Agents defined by this project in `.claude/agents/` are first-class framework agents for this project.
- **Sessions:** `/protocol` starts new work, `/continue` resumes it, `/pause` checkpoints it.
- **Tasks:** `tc` is the live state for initiatives, tasks, and work products. Store detailed output with `tc wp store` and return a summary.
- **Memory:** `cc memory` holds durable decisions and lessons that other sessions, Codex, and other machines must see. Claude Code's own auto memory is for personal working notes only.
- **Skills on demand:** if a needed skill did not surface, `cc skill search "<topic>"`, then `cc skill get <name>`.
- **Library docs:** `cc docs get <package> --topic <area> --json` before coding against a third-party API.
- **Health:** `cc doctor`. A failing `instruction-layer-unenforced` check means the hooks are not registered and nothing above is enforced.

## Knowledge Copilot

Knowledge Copilot is the source of truth for brand, voice, offerings, products, and methodologies. Consult it before writing any of these; never invent or duplicate it. Status: inherited from this machine (`everyone-needs-a-copilot`).

Run `eval "$(cc env)"`, then walk `$CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPOS` nearest tier first and read the first repo where the sub-path exists. Never dereference the singular `$CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPO` for a sub-path.

| Domain | Sub-path |
|--------|----------|
| Brand and visual | `01-company/01-brand/` |
| Voice and tone | `01-company/02-voice/` |
| Services and offerings | `01-company/03-services/` |
| Methodologies | `01-company/06-methodologies/` |
| Products and ecosystem registry | `02-products/`, `ECOSYSTEM.md` |

Full contract: `docs/00-knowledge-copilot/02-consumption-contract.md` in the organization knowledge tier.

## Optional Context

Mandatory repository/project/system instructions always apply; never filter or load them here.

Load needed additional knowledge once; use `selected[].content` or do not load it:

    cc skill select "<task topic>" --required <skill> --max-chars 12000 --json

Record one receipt per task, not per load:

    tc wp store --task <id> --type context --title "Context selection receipt" --file receipt.json

Keep `query`, `max_chars`, `loaded_characters`, `mandatory_over_budget`; each
`selected`/`excluded` entry's `name`, `source`, `source_revision`, `selection_reason`
or `reason`, not content. Before reselection read the receipt; skip held revisions.
Reload only changes; record both revisions and announce the change.

Retain required skills in full if `mandatory_over_budget: true`; report `max_chars`
and overage `loaded_characters - max_chars`. Characters are not tokens; receipts
prove selection, not reading/obedience.

Keep every required name in `selected[]`; identical aliases have `duplicate_of`,
empty `content`, zero charged characters/bytes: use the selected entry named by
`duplicate_of`. Optional
duplicates stay `excluded[]` as `duplicate-content`.

**Visible fallbacks:** name the applicable one, then continue:

- `cc` absent/nonzero: report failure/stderr; use repository instructions and prior memory only.
- Exit 2, `Required skill not found: <name>`: name it, never substitute; proceed without it or emit `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` if indispensable.
- `selected: []`: report no match for the query; use repository instructions, never widen the query to force a match.
- `CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPOS` empty: "Knowledge tier
  unconfigured; optional context limited to project and machine skills." Never block.

## Task Acceptance and Tested Identity

QA-required work uses `tc` evidence binding. The `me` and `qa` agents carry the full contract; the main session must not shortcut it.

- Before implementation, register an acceptance contract with `tc task contract <id> --file <path>`: `schemaVersion: 2`, `criteria: [{id, expected}]` with unique IDs and observable single-line expectations, and project-relative `sources` covering implementation, dependencies, and relevant configuration.
- Capture `tc task evidence-identity <id>` before and after verification and keep the exact `IDENTITY:` line in the work product. If content changed, rerun the affected checks against the new identity.
- Report each check as `CRITERION:` / `EXPECTED:` with the actual observation and verdict. Never downgrade `requiresQa` or substitute prose for source evidence; completion rechecks the contract, identities, hashes, and unfinished dependencies.

## Standing Rules

- **No time estimates.** Plans, roadmaps, and task breakdowns use phases, priorities, complexity, and dependencies, never dates or durations. This framework rule holds even when asked directly.
